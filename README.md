 # *Research Plan*


	With my research plan I am trying to see if it is possible for me to setup an irc server. 
  
  ## Background IRC
  
  IRC was created by Jarkko Oikarinen in August 1988 to replace a program called MUT (MultiUser Talk). 
  The first IRC network was running on a single server named tolsun.oulu. Oikarinen found inspiration in a chat system known as Bitnet Relay, which operated on the BITNET. 
  Jyrki Kuoppala pushed Jarkko to ask Oulu University to free the IRC code.
  This could be run outside of Oulu, and after they finally got it released, Jyrki Kuoppala immediately installed another server. 
 This was the first "irc network". 
 Jarkko got some friends at the Helsinki University and Tampere University to start running IRC servers when his number of users increased and other universities soon followed.
 An irc server is an internet relay chat. This is an application layer protocol that facilitates communication in the form of text. 
 ## Goal
 The goal is to make sure you are able to communicate with people using the irc server. 
 The materials needed to complete this would require a computer, wifi, steps to install the server and possibly a raspberry pi. 
 ## Risks
 * The risks of doing this is the possibility of getting a viris. 
 * These risks can occur if the server is open and someone sends malware through an attachment.  
 ## Difficulty
 As far as difficulty I do not believe it will be that difficult to setup unless you are having a hard time following the right steps.
 ## Steps
 1. Get the materials you need
 2. Follow the steps with installing inspIRCd, then configure InspIRCd. 
 3. The installation of inspircd creates a default configuration file.
 4. Then you must set the server details for your server and then set the admin details too. 
 After this you can start your server and log on. You should be in a chat room after this is done then you can communicate with others.
 ## Projected outcome 
 I believe that this will be a project that will take some time to complete.
 I think I will be able to complete this but I know it will be hard.
 If I am not able to complete this then I think it will be because the steps will be hard to follow.
